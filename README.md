# Hellsreach-lab

Welcome to my homelab repository! 

This space documents the design, infrastructure, and automation workflows behind my personal lab environment. I built this homelab to deepen my understanding of enterprise-level technologies, network security, container orchestration, and CI/CD pipeline automation.

Core Objectives

Continuous Learning: Experiment with enterprise tools, virtualization, and automation.

Automation First: Build and refine CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure management, and network configurations.

Security & Scalability: Design a robust and segmented network to ensure isolation, security, and reliability.

Experimentation: Explore new technologies, integrate monitoring solutions, and optimize system performance.

üì° Network and Infrastructure

Network Topology

Core Switch: Cisco Catalyst 3850

Router: MikroTik RB3011 (handling Wireless, Guest Wireless, and IoT VLANs)

Trunk Link: Established between Cisco and MikroTik for VLAN management


VLANs and Network Segmentation

Infrastructure VLAN: For critical services and core infrastructure

Servers VLAN: Isolated environment for VMs, Docker containers, and back-end services

Desktops VLAN: For workstations and development machines

WAPS VLAN: Segregated VLAN for wireless access points

Cameras VLAN: Dedicated network for IP surveillance devices

IoT VLAN: Isolated for smart home and IoT devices, restricting local access

üìö Personal Development Goals

Why I Built This Lab

My homelab is more than just a sandbox‚Äîit's an evolving environment designed to refine my technical knowledge, troubleshoot complex systems, and experiment with automation frameworks. This hands-on approach allows me to:

Develop DevOps Skills: Master Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitLab CI/CD practices.

Enhance Network Security Knowledge: Gain expertise in VLAN segmentation, firewall configuration, and wireless security.

Gain Cloud and Infrastructure Proficiency: Explore hybrid cloud solutions, container orchestration, and scalable deployments.


Certifications and Career Aspirations

Current Certifications: CCNA, Diploma I.T Administration

Future Goals: CCNP, possibly PRINCE2

Other goal:
Enhance DevOps expertise, explore Terraform and GitLab for managing infrastructure as code, and contribute to open-source projects related to automation and monitoring.
